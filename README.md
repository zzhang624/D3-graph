A Force-Directed Graph, or Force-Based Graph, is a type of layout commonly used in a variety of application areas: network visualization, large graph visualization, knowledge representation, system management, or mesh visualization.

It is used to visualize the connections between objects in a network. By grouping the objects connected to each other in a natural way, a Force-Directed Graph is visually interesting and also makes it possible to discover subtle relationships between groups.
