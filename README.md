# Force-directed graph

A Force-Directed Graph, or Force-Based Graph, is a type of layout commonly used in a variety of application areas: network visualization, large graph visualization, knowledge representation, system management, or mesh visualization.

It is used to visualize the connections between objects in a network. By grouping the objects connected to each other in a natural way, a Force-Directed Graph is visually interesting and also makes it possible to discover subtle relationships between groups.

## dragging node
Each node can be dragged. 
## Pinning nodes
When you double click on a node, it pins the nodeâ€™s position such that it will not be modified by the graph layout algorithm (note: pinned nodes can still be dragged around by the user but they will remain at their positions otherwise). Node pinning is an effective interaction technique to help users spatially organize nodes during graph exploration. Double clicking a pinned node should unpin (unfreeze) its position and unmark it.
